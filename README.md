A PocketMine-MP plugin that implements support for custom blocks, items and entities.
> It is important to note that custom blocks will not work properly with other plugins that also modify the runtime
> block
> mappings, such as [INether](https://github.com/ipad54/INether) and [VanillaX](https://github.com/CLADevs/VanillaX).
